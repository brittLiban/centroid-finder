🎨 The Problem with Euclidean RGB Distance
    You’ve been using Euclidean distance in RGB space:

    java
    Copy
    sqrt((r1 - r2)^2 + (g1 - g2)^2 + (b1 - b2)^2)
    This works mathematically, but not visually accurate. Here's why:

    The RGB color space is not perceptually uniform.

    A difference of ΔR = 30 might look barely noticeable in one case, but very noticeable in another, depending on what green and blue are doing.

    Human vision is more sensitive to green than red or blue, and perceives brightness in a non-linear way.

👁️ Enter Perceptual Color Spaces (like CIELAB)
    The CIELAB (aka Lab) color space was designed to model human vision more accurately.

    💡 Key idea:
    A distance of "1 unit" in Lab space should always feel like the same visual difference to a human, regardless of what color you're looking at.

🧮 The Delta E Formula
    To compute perceptual difference between two colors in Lab space, we use Delta E (ΔE).

    The most common version:

    ✅ ΔE76:

    Copy
    ΔE = sqrt((L1-L2)² + (a1-a2)² + (b1-b2)²)
    Where:

    L = lightness

    a = green-red channel

    b = blue-yellow channel

🧑‍💻 How to use this in Java?
    Step 1: Convert RGB to Lab
    This involves several steps:

    RGB → Linear RGB

    Linear RGB → XYZ (CIE standard color space)

    XYZ → Lab

    Java doesn’t do this natively, but you can:

    Use libraries like Apache Commons Imaging, color-thief, or TwelveMonkeys

    Or implement the conversion yourself (doable, but math-heavy)
